# Data Science Midterm Project

## Project/Goals

The project aims to predict housing list prices using machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to understand how various features impact housing list prices and develop a predictive model to accurately estimate list prices based on these features.

## Process
### (your step 1)

-Data Collection and Preprocessing

-Acquired housing dataset from [source].

-Explored and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### (your step 2)

-Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between different features and the target variable (list prices).

-Visualized key insights using plots and charts to identify patterns and correlations.

### (your step 3)

-Split the data into training and testing sets.

-Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, XGBoost) to predict housing list prices.

-Evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Results

Some predictions made by XGBoost model on test dataset:

These predictions provide insights into the model's performance and can be compared against the actual list prices to assess its accuracy.


## Challenges 

-The dataset required extensive cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Time-consuming and requires careful consideration to ensure data quality.

-Selecting the right model/hyperparameters

-Time constraints

-Deciding which metrics to use


## Future Goals

If more time were available, I would focus on the following tasks to enhance the project:

Feature Engineering
Invest more time in feature engineering to extract additional insights from the dataset. This could involve creating new features, transforming existing ones, or incorporating external data sources to enrich the feature set.

Model Tuning and Ensemble Methods
Conduct more extensive hyperparameter tuning for the machine learning models to improve their performance. Additionally, explore ensemble methods such as stacking or boosting to combine the strengths of multiple models for better prediction accuracy.
